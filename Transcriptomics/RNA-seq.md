# RNA-Seq Analysis

**Author:** *Deyanira Borroto Alburquerque*

### Abstract

***This RNA-Seq analysis is based on 17 samples (4â€“5 independent biological replicates of LLI-NT, LLI-VIP, ALI-NT, and ALIVIP differentiated Caco-2 cells).***\
***"The goal of the project is to investigate the impact of liquid-liquid interface (LLI) and air-liquid interface (ALI) with addition of vasointestinal peptide (VIP) on intestinal barrier properties and mucus production of Caco-2 cell cultures. Caco-2 cells were cultured in transwell plates under LLI and ALI condition and VIP were added to basolateral compartment. LLI-NT, LLI-VIP, ALI-NT and ALI-VIP were collected and analysis using RNAseq." (https://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/index.html?view=study&acc=SRP489490)***

### Getting the experiment Data

The data utilized for this RNA-seq analysis was obtained from the "Air-liquid interface Caco-2 culture with vasointestinal peptide mimicks gut mucosal barrier function in permeability and bacterial infection" [study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39714032/).

> To get the data the GEO accession [GSE283451](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE283451) was accessed.\
> Where the Raw data available in SRA was found under the BioProject accession [PRJNA1076117](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/study/?acc=PRJNA1076117&o=acc_s%3Aa).
