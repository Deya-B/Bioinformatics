==============
**Author:** *Deyanira Borroto Alburquerque*

### Abstract
***This RNA-Seq analysis is based on 17 samples (4â€“5 independent biological replicates of LLI-NT, LLI-VIP, ALI-NT, and ALIVIP differentiated Caco-2 cells)***   

**Keywords:** RNA-Seq; Next-generation sequencing; Data analysis; Differentially expressed genes
