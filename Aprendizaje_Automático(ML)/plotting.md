If the last 6 plots don't provide useful insights, you might need a different **visualization strategy**. Here are some alternative approaches to better distinguish **benign (B) vs malignant (M)** cases using **mean nuclear features** from the dataset:

---

### **1. Violin Plots (Better than KDE for Comparing Distributions)**
Instead of Kernel Density Estimation (KDE), **violin plots** combine KDE with a boxplot structure. They **show the full distribution** of each feature, making them great for comparing benign vs malignant cases.

####  **How to Modify Your Code:**
```python
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Set up the plot
fig, axes = plt.subplots(nrows=5, ncols=2, figsize=(8, 12))
axes = axes.ravel()  # Flatten the array of axes

# Iterate through features and create violin plots
for idx, ax in enumerate(axes):
    feature = features_mean[idx]  # Select the feature
    sns.violinplot(x=df['diagnosis'], y=df[feature], ax=ax, palette=["blue", "orange"])
    ax.set_title(feature)

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```
 **Why Violin Plots?**
- They **clearly show density variations** (unlike boxplots).
- Good for spotting **overlapping distributions** (e.g., features that don't separate M & B well).

---

### **2.Swarm Plots (Great for Seeing Individual Data Points)**
Swarm plots **plot each point** instead of just summary statistics. This is helpful for visualizing **data density and overlaps**.

#### **Code:**
```python
fig, axes = plt.subplots(nrows=5, ncols=2, figsize=(8, 12))
axes = axes.ravel()

for idx, ax in enumerate(axes):
    feature = features_mean[idx]
    sns.swarmplot(x=df['diagnosis'], y=df[feature], ax=ax, palette=["blue", "orange"], size=2)
    ax.set_title(feature)

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```
 **Why Swarm Plots?**
- You see **individual points** instead of just distributions.
- Highlights **outliers** clearly.
- Useful when you have **moderate sample sizes**.

---

### **3. Box Plots (Classic Way to Show Distributions)**
If KDE isn't working well, **box plots** might be better.

####  **Code:**
```python
fig, axes = plt.subplots(nrows=5, ncols=2, figsize=(8, 12))
axes = axes.ravel()

for idx, ax in enumerate(axes):
    feature = features_mean[idx]
    sns.boxplot(x=df['diagnosis'], y=df[feature], ax=ax, palette=["blue", "orange"])
    ax.set_title(feature)

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```
 **Why Box Plots?**
- Easy to **compare medians** & interquartile ranges (IQR).
- **Good for detecting skewness** & outliers.

---

### **4. Scatter Plots (Pairwise Feature Comparison)**
Since we are working with **mean nuclear features**, we can **compare two features** directly.

####  **Example:**
```python
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
sns.scatterplot(x=df['radius_mean'], y=df['concavity_mean'], hue=df['diagnosis'], palette=["blue", "orange"])
plt.title("Comparison of Radius Mean vs Concavity Mean")
plt.show()
```
 **Why Scatter Plots?**
- Helps visualize **correlations** between features.
- If **two features separate well**, they could be useful for classification.

---

### **5. Pairplot (Quick Feature Exploration)**
Use `sns.pairplot()` to **compare all mean features** at once.

####  **Code:**
```python
sns.pairplot(df, hue='diagnosis', vars=features_mean, palette=["blue", "orange"])
plt.show()
```
 **Why Pairplot?**
- Itâ€™s **quick and easy** for identifying **feature relationships**.
- Great for seeing **which features separate benign vs malignant cases**.

---

### **ðŸŽ¯ Which One Should You Choose?**
 If you want **clear comparisons between B vs M**, go for **violin plots** or **box plots**.  
 If you need to **see individual data points**, use **swarm plots**.  
 If you want to **compare multiple features**, try **scatter plots or pair plots**.

---

### **ðŸŽ¯ Final Suggestion**
Try running **violin plots** first and see if the distributions for **malignant vs benign cases** look different. If some features don't separate well, check **scatter plots** or **pairplots** to find better distinguishing features.
