### Given functions:
\[
n,  \sqrt{n}, n^{1.5}, n^2, n \log n, n \log \log n, n \log^2 n, \frac{2}{n}, 2n, \frac{2^n}{2}, 37, n^2 \log n, n^3
\]
To sort the given functions according to their growth rate from **slowest** to **fastest**, we analyze their asymptotic behavior using **Big-O notation**.

### Step 1: Identify Growth Rates
1. **Constant Function** (slowest growth):  
   - \( 37 = O(1) \)

2. **Inverse Growth** (decreasing function):  
   - \( \frac{2}{n} = O(1/n) \) (shrinks as \( n \) increases)

3. **Logarithmic and Sublinear Growth**:  
   - \( \sqrt{n} = O(n^{0.5}) \)
   - \( n \log \log n \) (grows slightly faster than \( n \))
   - \( n \log n \) (grows faster than \( n \log \log n \))

4. **Polynomial Growth**:  
   - \( n = O(n) \)  
   - \( 2n = O(n) \) (same growth as \( n \), just a constant multiplier)  
   - \( n^{1.5} = O(n^{1.5}) \)  
   - \( n^2 = O(n^2) \)  
   - \( n^2 \log n \) (slightly faster than \( n^2 \))  
   - \( n^3 = O(n^3) \)

5. **Exponential Growth** (fastest growth):  
   - \( \frac{2^n}{2} = O(2^n) \) (dominates all polynomial functions)

### Step 2: Sorting by Growth Order
From slowest to fastest:
\[
\frac{2}{n}, 37, \sqrt{n}, n, 2n, n \log \log n, n \log n, n^{1.5}, n \log^2 n, n^2, n^2 \log n, n^3, \frac{2^n}{2}
\]  

This order reflects increasing growth rates based on asymptotic analysis. ðŸš€
