## Getting started
### Setting Up GitHub
1. Create a GitHub Account (if you donâ€™t have one).
2. Fork the OncoSimulR Repository:
  - Go to the OncoSimulR GitHub page.
  - Click the "Fork" button to create a copy in your GitHub account.
3. Clone Your Fork Locally.
4. Set Up Remote for Updates. Add the original repository as the upstream remote.

### Installing Dependencies
Install OncoSimulR from Bioconductor:
Installing from Bioconductor ensures all dependencies are met:
```R
# R
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")

BiocManager::install("OncoSimulR")
```

### Familiarizing with OncoSimulR
Understand the Basics:
- Read the documentation.
- Review examples and vignettes: browseVignettes("OncoSimulR").
- Review Relevant Literature:
    - Check papers cited in the project file, focusing on intra-tumor heterogeneity, mutation rates, and sampling strategies.

### Running Simulations
Start small:
- Try simple simulations using example models provided in the vignettes.
- Modify parameters incrementally.
Consider scenarios outlined in the project specs (e.g., heterogeneity, SSWM).

### Project Reporting
Final Deliverables:

- Detailed presentation summarizing results.
- Simulated scenarios and parameter explanations (as described in Section 5 of the project file).
Documentation:
- Include clear descriptions of simulations and their interpretations in the repository (e.g., via a README.md).



## Basics of OncoSimulR
OncoSimulR is an R package designed to simulate cancer evolution under different mutation and selection dynamics. It is particularly useful for studying processes such as tumor heterogeneity, clonal dynamics, and fitness landscapes. Here's a breakdown of the key components:

### 1. Fitness Landscapes
Definition:
- In cancer biology, fitness represents the ability of a cell (or genotype) to survive, proliferate, and pass on its genetic material.
- Higher fitness means a genotype is more likely to dominate the population.

Fitness in OncoSimulR:
- You define fitness values based on genotypes or specific mutations.
- Fitness landscapes can be additive (fitness is summed across mutations) or epistatic (interactions between mutations influence fitness).

Example:
```R
fitness_table <- data.frame(
  Genotype = c("WT", "A", "B", "A, B"),
  Fitness = c(1, 1.2, 0.8, 1.5)
)
```
Here, mutation A increases fitness to 1.2, while B alone decreases it to 0.8. The combination of A and B has a synergistic effect (fitness = 1.5).

### 2. Mutations
Mutations are the driver of genetic diversity in tumor populations.

OncoSimulR allows:
- Specifying mutation rates for individual genes.
- Simulating the impact of mutations on fitness.
```R
mutator <- allFitnessEffects(
  genotFitness = fitness_table,
  mutationRates = c(A = 1e-6, B = 2e-6)
)
```
### 3. Simulation Dynamics
OncoSimulR simulates tumor growth over time by tracking:
- Clones: Subpopulations of cells with distinct genotypes.
- Fitness dynamics: How fitness landscapes affect clonal expansion.
- Mutation acquisition: The accumulation of mutations over generations.

Types of Simulations:
- McFarland model: Simulates the effect of deleterious mutations in cancer progression.
- Continuous models: Simulates clonal dynamics under fitness constraints.

### Example Workflow in OncoSimulR
Define the Fitness Landscape:
```R
fitness_table <- data.frame(
  Genotype = c("WT", "A", "B", "A, B"),
  Fitness = c(1, 1.1, 0.9, 1.3)
)
```
Use the `allFitnessEffects()` function to build the model.

Simulate Tumor Evolution:
```R
mutator <- allFitnessEffects(
  genotFitness = fitness_table,
  mutationRates = c(A = 1e-6, B = 2e-6)
)

sim <- oncoSimulIndiv(mutator, model = "McFL", finalTime = 1000)
```

Visualize Results:
```R
plotClones(sim)
plotDrivers(sim)
```

### Understanding Fitness
Fitness in the context of cancer evolution refers to the capacity of a genotype to outcompete others in the tumor microenvironment. It encapsulates:
- Proliferation rate: Faster-dividing cells have a higher fitness.
- Survival: Cells that resist apoptosis or evade immune detection are fitter.
- Adaptation: Cells that adapt to hypoxia or therapy have selective advantages.

#### Why Fitness Matters in Cancer Simulations
Tumor Heterogeneity:
- Tumors comprise multiple clones with varying fitness levels.
- Understanding fitness differences explains why some clones dominate.

Treatment Resistance:
- High-fitness clones may evolve resistance to therapies.
- Predicting these clones can guide combination therapies.

Epistasis:
- Interactions between mutations can alter fitness.
- Modeling these interactions helps in understanding synergistic or antagonistic effects.
